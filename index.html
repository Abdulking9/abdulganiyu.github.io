        I am interested in web-based systems, secure and intelligent applications, and applying emerging technologies such as AI and blockchain to
        solve problems in education and campus administration. I previously built a <strong>Web-Based Incident Reporting System for AAMUSTED</strong> to
        streamline the management of security incidents on campus.
      </p>
      <p class="opening">
        Openings: I am open to research collaborations, graduate assistantships, and projects in web systems, AI for education, and cybersecurity.

  <!-- Biography -->
  <section class="wrap section">
    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      I am an international student from Ghana with a background in Computer Science. My undergraduate research focused on designing and implementing
      a secure, usable, and scalable incident reporting platform for the Akenten Appiah-Menka University of Skills Training and Entrepreneurial Development (AAMUSTED).
      My long-term goal is to build trustworthy, AI-powered and web-based systems that can be deployed in African higher education institutions and smart
      communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been admitted to multiple graduate programs (Wayne State University – CS; University of Michigan–Flint – CSIS) and I am working to strengthen
      my research profile with projects in web security, AI content tools, and collaborative research with faculty members such as <strong>Prof. Yi Zhu</strong>
      (autonomous driving security, CPS/IoT, adversarial sensing).

      <h3>[UG Research] A Web-Based Incident Reporting System for AAMUSTED</h3>
      <p><strong>Abdul Ganiyu Abdul Latif</strong></p>
      <p>
        This project developed a web platform that enables students, staff, and security officers to digitally submit, track, and analyze campus
        security incidents. The system supports role-based access, evidence upload, and real-time tracking of case status to improve campus safety and
        administrative visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Technologies:</em> PHP / MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, basic authentication, database design, usability testing.

        A conversational assistant built to help undergraduates query course materials, past questions, and programming labs. The system was experimented
        with OpenAI-style LLM APIs and Streamlit as a simple frontend.

      <p>
        Exploratory work on using historical incident data from a campus reporting platform to forecast peak periods, common incident types, and
        resource allocation needs. The aim was to integrate this with the reporting system for proactive alerts.
